The security key info command displays the status of all PIV slots on a connected
YubiKey, including certificate details and private key presence.

For each populated slot, it shows the certificate subject, expiration date, and
whether a private key is present. This is useful for verifying YubiKey contents
and diagnosing issues with key storage.
