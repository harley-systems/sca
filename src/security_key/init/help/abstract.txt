The security key init command is used for first time initialization of the
currently inserted cryptographic token secure storage device as well as for
security key access keys.

A security key initialization consists of setting the three security key access
keys: pin, puk and the management key. The passwords are randomly generated and
saved to the keys file-system.

You should write down the pin and remember the pin. It's 6 digits that you will
need to use to access the keys stored on the token device.

It is good to have the management key somewhere on paper as well although it is
best used only in air-gapped environment where it's safe to attach the keys
file-system.

Rolling (assigning new values to) the access keys is also performed by this
command when ran with appropriate parameters.

IMPORTANT NOTE: this command shall be run in an air-gapped (offline,
disconnected from the internet) environment.
