The security key id command is used for retrieving ids of the currently inserted
cryptographic token secure storage devices.

A security key id is the first 6 hexadecimal numbers of the token secure storage
device serial number, separated by dash '-' character.

The opensc card reader number associated with the security key is printed along
with the security key id with white space as a separator.

In case there are more than one security keys connected to the computer, they
will all be displayed one on each line.

In case there are no security keys connected to the system, dash sign is
displayed for both security key id and the card reader number.
