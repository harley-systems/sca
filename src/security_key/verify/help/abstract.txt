The security key verify command tests whether a private key is present and
functional on the YubiKey for a given entity. It does this by attempting to
sign test data with the key.

This is the only reliable way to detect private key presence, as tools like
ykman and yubico-piv-tool may incorrectly report keys as missing due to
display bugs.
