The initialize yubikey command is used for initializing a security hardware device
from Yubico company called yubikey.

The initialization is necessary only in first time use of the key in case it was
previously uninitialized. The key comes pre-initialized with publicly known
credentials and therefore needs re-creating of all it's access keys:
  - management key
  - pin key
  - puk key

Those are automatically changed from default factory preset to randomly generated
and saved values.

It is recommended to issue init command every now and then with --roll-keys option
so that you refresh the stale access passwords for a yubikey.

IMPORTANT: In case you have already initialized yubikey, you will need to
configure the above mentioned keys by setting the content of the related entity
hw key configuration settings.
