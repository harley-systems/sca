sca_usb_stick_options:

  -h, --help                    - print this help
  -s, --skip-cleanup            - optional flag, preserve intermediary files
                                  created during live iso image creation.
                                  this option is useful in case you want to
                                  further customize sca iso image.
  -t, --test-images             - optional flag create iso image for sca test.
                                  the slight
                                  difference between the regular image is that
                                  the test image automatically starts sca test
                                  on end of booting.
  -i, --include-apt-mirror      - optional flag includes all restricted Ubuntu packages within
                                  the image by storing apt-mirror within it and
                                  configuring offline environment package
                                  manager to use it.
                                  NOTE: we do include offline repository of
                                  yubico yubikey tools regardless of this
                                  option being set or not and depending on
                                  another dedicated flag -y.
  -y, --yubikey-support         - optional flag includes apt-mirror of the yubikey tools in
                                  the image and installs the tools along with
                                  sca installation.
  -x, --exclude-pkcs11-support  - optional flag if specified excludes bundling of pkcs11
                                  support in the generated sca usb image
  -q, --no-cache-squashfs       - optional flag indicating we do not want to
                                  preserve a copy of the squashfs file containing
                                  all the unmodified directories of live file
                                  system.
                                  default value is false.
                                  default behavior is to cache the squashfs file
                                  per ubuntu_version_id in the ~/.sca/downloads/
                                  folder.
                                  if set, we instead extract the whole live
                                  file-system squashfs and re-compress it again
                                  with mksquashfs.
                                  enabling this flag prolongs the time it takes
                                  to complete the operation if ran multiple times.
                                  on the cons side, it takes up some disk space
                                  upon operation completion.
  -o, --no-cache-iso            - optional flag indicating we do not want to
                                  preserve a copy of the downloaded iso file
                                  for the specified ubuntu_version_id.
                                  default value is false.
                                  default behavior is to cache the squashfs file

                                  upon operation completion.
  -n, --no-cache                - optional flag.
                                  default value is false.
                                  switches off all caching. suitable for one
                                  time runs, where there is no advantage in
                                  caching large downloaded files.
