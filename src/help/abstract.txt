While OpenSSL has been around for a while, there are not many people practicing
the powerful encryption provided by it. When need to setup a ca, most just
copy-paste the OpenSSL related commands blindly and get the temporary in-secure
solution into production use, postponing dealing with it safely into the
engineering backlogs that will never be addressed.

In today's world where hardware security devices cheap and widely available, and
virtually all OS's and services supporting PKI related industry standards,
the only reason for not doing the PKI properly is cryptic parameters and
numerous installations and configurations needed to get the things running.

The simple certificate authority is a shell script that addresses this challenge
by providing simple interface to cryptography tools arsenal. It uses standard
bullet proof tools to provide it's function and exposes them in much more
intuitive and usable way.
